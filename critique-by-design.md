# Title

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

_Include link to the original data visualization (or screenshot - make sure to correctly cite your sources, etc.).  Include paragraph or two on why you selected this particular data visualization.  For obvious reasons, the data visualization you select should come from a publicly accessible source._

## Step two: the critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Arts Management student from MX | Arts Management Student from TX |
|----------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| What worked? | Fun eye tracking experience with the annotated callouts | The pie chart is clear, so good strcture choice                                |
| What was exciting?         | I love how timely it is, and the responses are moving through time clockwise in the chart.                                 | Calling out 'Never' category drew my eyes there and the positive, green color assigned to the piece of the pie made perfect sense as it denoted an achievement or completion of NY's Resolutions.|
| What didn't work? | Color choice feels random.| Consider adding a subheader to indicate X% of the population quit by X time.|
| What questions came up? What made you curious? | What color gradients could we use to celebrate those who achieved their resolutions? What is the sample size? | How could a color gradient be effective here to show the spectrum of those who quit earliest to those who achieve their goals?|

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
