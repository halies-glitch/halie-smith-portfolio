My final project tells a data-driven story about how graduate students are consistently sleeping less than recommended levels and how this affects their academic performance, concentration, and emotional well-being. This narrative uses national datasets to illustrate that even one additional hour of sleep can meaningfully improve cognitive functioning and mood. The goal is to encourage graduate students, instructors, and administrators to view sleep not as an afterthought, but as an essential academic resource.

For Part II, I drafted a full narrative using Shorthand and built five data visualizations in Datawrapper. Using my wireframes, I established the flow of information and the rhythm of the story, ensuring that each visualization meaningfully advances the audience’s understanding of the topic.

# User research 
My target audience is
- Current graduate students
- Professors and academic advisors
- Higher ed administrators

# User Needs
From quick informal interviews with classmates, I found the following
Students want reassurance, not judgment.
- They prefer simple, striking visualizations instead of complex statistical models.
- They value emotional validation.
- They respond to realistic, achievable recommendations and a memorable call to action.

# Research Goals
- Determine whether the introduction is clear with broader sleep context
- Identify whether CMU-specific examples increase relevance
- Evaluate whether data visualizations are readable and persuasive
- Assess whether the CTA feels achievable and appropriate
- Determine whether the pie chart is helpful or confusing
- Check for emotional tone: is it supportive, not judgmental?

## Interview script
1. Does the introduction clearly set up the story?
2. Which visualization was hardest to interpret?
3. Does the story feel relevant to your experience at CMU?
4. Does the final Call To Action feel actionable?
5. What would make this project more useful for CMU students or faculty?

My final project is currently drafted in Shorthand for narrative structure and Datawrapper for all data visualizations. This combination allows me to build a clean, interactive, and visually consistent story. Shorthand organizes the narrative flow, while Datawrapper provides accessible, striking charts. All datasets will be publicly accessible and linked directly in my final submission.
