# HIGH-LEVEL SUMMARY
Graduate school asks students to learn, produce, collaborate, and research at a pace that almost feels nonstop. With so many responsibilities competing for time in the classroom, sleep often falls to the back burner. My final project will explore that graduate students are functioning on far less sleep than experts recommend, and thus impact how they learn, how they think critically, and therefore how they’re performing in both their academic and personal lives.

I invite graduate students and educators to reflect on their own sleep habits and rethink the role it plays in graduate school. Instead of rest falling to the bottom of a growing to-do list, this project will propose sleep as a powerful academic weapon for every graduate student’s toolkit. I hope to show that consistent sleep contributes to improved academic performance and increased emotional well-being and happiness. I want my audience to feel empowered to rest more and do better both in and out of the classroom.

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 

# MAJOR ELEMENTS OF MY STORY
Graduate students often sleep far less than recommended, and the data suggests that even small increases in sleep can lead to stronger academic performance and healthier emotional state. As a graduate student, I want to understand how sleep affects my ability to learn so that I can make better time management decisions and align priorities. In telling this story, the goal is to help graduate students, educators, and university administrators understand the value of sleep. I want my audience to reframe how they view resting and instead see it as something that supports academic success. In turn, how sleep deprivation can eat away at performance and morale. My story will allow students permission to put themselves first and provide educators with insights that could boost student support initiatives.

SETTING THE STAGE
The story begins with an honest truth: Graduate students are not getting enough sleep. So, how much are they really getting? What are we missing out on? I’ll introduce national statistics on sleep and compare with student data across universities in the U.S. The contrast forms a natural tension and introduces the problem, as I work to explain the solution.

UNPACKING SLEEP PATTERNS (or lack thereof)
This section focuses on the relationship between hours of sleep and academic performance, stress, and indicators of emotional well-being. Here, I will build empathy and understand the gravity of what sleep deprivation holds graduate students back from.

BRIDING SLEEP TO SUCCESS
The story wraps by bringing the data together in a way that is clear, engaging, and motivating. The audience should feel encouraged to prioritize healthy sleep patterns and express the want to sleep more, so they can achieve academic success and overall happiness. A little goes a long way, and moderate improvements in rest supports clear thinking, consistency, and a balanced emotional wellbeing. Rather than feeling judged, I want my audience to feel confident in how they can improve their lives by changing the tide of graduate students’ relationships with sleep.

# SKETCH 3: Sleep and Emotional Well-Being
I have concepts of a plan for the third sketch, but I haven’t worked through it entirely on paper or in Datawrapper to draft at the moment. I need to spend more time working with the data.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

To explore the relationship between graduate student sleep patterns and academic performance, my draws on several publicly available national datasets. The National College Health Assessment (NCHA) provides self-reported sleep behaviors from tens of thousands of U.S. graduate and undergraduate students each year, offering a foundation for identifying sleep duration averages, stress indicators, and mental wellness patterns. To meaningfully connect sleep with academic outcomes, I will incorporate datasets from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the National Sleep Foundation (NSF), which supply widely accepted benchmarks for recommended sleep duration and cognitive functioning. Together, these sources allow me to highlight the gap between how much sleep graduate students actually get and the amount experts say supports learning, memory consolidation, and emotional resilience.

In my final project, these datasets will shape the charts I build in Datawrapper and the story I tell through Shorthand. I’ll show how much sleep graduate students actually get, compare it to national recommendations, and highlight patterns between sleep, academic performance, and emotional well-being. These visualizations will make it easy to see that even small increases in sleep, as little as one extra hour per night, can support clearer thinking, better grades, and lower stress. Altogether, the data will help reinforce the core message of the project: sleep isn’t optional for graduate students; it’s an essential tool for success.

# Method and medium
My final project will likely be created using Shorthand to best represent the story I’m trying to tell with data visualizations. I will also use Datawrapper to build charts as best I can, I am still learning the quirks of that platform. I look forward to learning Shorthand in class on Thursday, so I can solidify my choice and start storyboarding this narrative that graduate students do not get enough sleep.
