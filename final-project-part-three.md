# The final data story
Behind the Scenes of Creating “Rest as a Requirment”

# What Changed Since Part II?

Between Part II and Part III, I focused on refining the clarity, pacing, and visual hierarchy of my Shorthand story. The core narrative remained the same: graduate students do not get enough sleep. However, I made adjustments to make the story more actionable and emotionally supportive based on user feedback.

I improved transitions between sections, simplified language around academic performance, and ensured each visualization clearly connected to the broader story. I also refined my fifth visualization into a pie chart to strengthen the call-to-action moment at the end of the story (“One Extra Hour Can Change the Day”). All five Datawrapper charts were rebuilt for consistency in color, formatting, and readability.

Most importantly, the full Shorthand site is now polished, published, and fully accessible as an interactive data story.

## The audience
Changes I Made Based on User Feedback
- Tightened introduction to get to the point faster
- Simplified copy around cognitive effects to avoid jargon
- Rewrote sections where tone risked feeling judgmental and accusational
- Cleaned up visual consistency across all Datawrapper charts.
- Added a more encouraging closing section: focusing on agency, not blame.
- Reduced text in several sections to improve Shorthand pacing and readability.

These choices ensured the story met users where they are: tired, overwhelmed, and in need of both clarity and encouragement.

I made design decisions guided by class principles and feedback from interviews:

## Final design decisions
- 5 data visualizations
- Dot plot, grouped bars, line chart, clustered bars, pie chart
- Used consistent color palette to create narrative flow and consistency

Each chart was positioned to build the argument:
- Here’s the problem.
- Here’s why it matters.
- Here’s how sleep affects academics.
- Here’s how sleep affects emotional well-being.
Here’s one meaningful change you can make.
- Clear headlines
- Percent labels and legends for faster interpretation

Working in Shorthand, I found the tool to foster a seamless, empowering interaction that laid the foundation to tell my story. I intentionally used whitespace and transitions to give the reader breathing room to digest the data and sit with their own feelings/viewpoints of rest. Overall, the design supports a story that is simple, calm, and motivating. 

This project helped me connect the dots between data, storytelling, and visual design in a deeper way. I learned:
- How to use Datawrapper effectively and intentionally
- How much pacing matters in long-form storytelling tools
- Data stories work best when users can see themselves in the narrative
- Simple visualizations often carry the most emotional weight
- How to shape a message for a specific audience and tone

# Final thoughts
I found this final project to go okay. Topic selection was the hardest, and I argue the most important part of this process because it sett he stage for what was to come. Given my very limited data experience, I wish I had more freedom of experimentation in Datawrapper to make visualiations stronger, however limited knowledge and time held me back from exploring other visualization avenues. I learned that I really enjoy working in Shorthand and plan to use it in the future for creative storytelling.
